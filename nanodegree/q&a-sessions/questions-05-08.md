# Q & A from August 4th session


### JS related
##### functionnal programming : 
the added value to use lodash (_.forEach() over jquery ($.each())?



##### objet declaration
The reasoning to recommend JSON format over vs objet litteral? JSON format breaks when adding function 

##### IIFEs & objects access  
With the use of IIFEs function (to control variable scope), i no longer have access to the objects declared in resumeBuilder.js

what would be a clean approach to avoid such failure 
    locations.push(bio.contacts.location);


### CSS related 
- Can't figure out why skills are not properly fetched 
- flexitem vs bootstrap model: pros & cons?
- the best (inital) approach to implement scrolling?
 
### Organisation related 
Have been away few days. Despite making the deadline for the Portfolio, did not have the time to 
build a V2 based on the reveiw comments. 

Any deadline related to this?
