# Questions from June 16th session


### gihub and lib
Regarding publishing to github, lib used in the project have been pushed (see bower_components)

This does not seem to be a good practice

### bootstrap
Nested div with the grid system (see markup for detail)

### long markup file
Good practice for long markup file: any option to split the file in includes

### others (specific questions)
- why the style of the a element got overwrittten by scafolding.less
- how to indicate the user that, on a click of any img, a modal will popup
